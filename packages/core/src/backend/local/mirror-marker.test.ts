// A MIRROR store must not be mistaken for a workspace store.
//
// Both look identical on disk: same path shape, same schema, a `local_root_path` pointing at
// the same folder. They mean opposite things. A workspace store is the authority for its
// content; a mirror is a local copy of an authority that lives elsewhere, kept so that work
// survives while that authority is unreachable.
//
// `discoverWorkspaceForCwd` scans every store under PATHRULE_HOME and returns any whose
// `local_root_path` covers the cwd, and callers ask it FIRST to decide which backend serves a
// folder. Without a way to tell the two apart, one mirrored write is enough to make that
// question answer "yes, this is a local workspace" for a folder whose authority is somewhere
// else: reads then come from a partial copy, and writes land in it with nothing behind them.
//
// So a mirror is marked, discovery skips marked stores, and the callers that genuinely want
// the mirror (resolving a cwd through the mirror's own registry while the authority is
// unreachable) ask for it explicitly.
