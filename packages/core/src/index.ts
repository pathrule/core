//
// This barrel is the package's PUBLIC API: the backend seam (the interface +
// its capability flags + the I/O contract types), the two shipped backends
// (the embedded-SQLite LocalBackend and the dependency-light InMemory reference,
// which third-party backend authors can use as a behavioral template), and the
// local principal resolver. Storage internals (the SQLite schema/migrations), the
// identity fallback constant, and the bring-your-own-embedding adapter are
// intentionally NOT re-exported — they are implementation details reachable
// internally by relative import, and exporting them would lock them into the
// package's compatibility surface.
