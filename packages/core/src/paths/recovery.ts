// Recovery for repos that were synced by an OLDER Pathrule, back when it took a
// user's instruction file over instead of merging a region into it.
//
// Those repos carry leftovers the new writers never produce:
//   - `backup.CLAUDE.md`, `backup.AGENTS.md`, `backup..cursorrules` (the double
//     dot came from prefixing an already-dotted filename) next to the original;
//   - `.pathrule/backups/<path>` entries from the interim vault layout;
//   - a live instruction file that is entirely Pathrule's, while the user's real
//     content sits in one of the above.
//
// The contract here is deliberately conservative: this module only REPORTS. It
// never restores automatically. A user may have deliberately abandoned that old
// file, and silently reviving it would be a second surprise on top of the first.
// The desktop turns a plan into an offer; the user decides per item.
//
// Pure and dependency-free: callers supply the file listing and contents, which
// keeps this testable and usable from desktop, CLI, and MCP alike.
