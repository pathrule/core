/**
 * Agent IR: the boundary between Pathrule's stored typed knowledge and a single agent execution.
 *
 * The capture half of Pathrule (observe -> understand -> validate -> persist -> review -> approve)
 * produces typed atoms. This module is the start of the delivery half: it takes APPROVED atoms
 * that are eligible for one execution, compiles them into a compact, engine-neutral representation,
 * and renders that representation as advisory text an agent can use. It is deliberately NOT a
 * database dump: the boundary is `Knowledge -> Agent IR -> rendered delivery`, not `SELECT * ->
 * JSON.stringify -> prompt`.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and every function here preserves them:
 *
 *  1. TYPE IS PRESERVED. A remedy is delivered as an advisory, never flattened into "remember this".
 *     The IR is a discriminated union so CONSTRAINT / CHECK / CONTEXT / SELECTION / PROCEDURE /
 *     RATIONALE / PRECEDENCE can be added later as new entry kinds without reshaping the boundary.
 *  2. AUTHORITY IS ENCODED, NOT FLATTENED. A REMEDY is advisory and never outranks a CONSTRAINT.
 *     Entries carry an `authority` band and render into clearly-subordinate sections, so advisory
 *     text is never concatenated with equal weight after a hard rule.
 *  3. NOTHING SEMANTIC HAPPENS AT DELIVERY. The expensive interpretation ran once at write-time.
 *     Compilation and rendering are pure, deterministic, and make zero model calls.
 *
 * This module is engine-neutral: it never branches on Claude / Codex / Cursor. A renderer produces
 * neutral markdown; the per-engine envelope is applied downstream by the existing hook `emit()`.
