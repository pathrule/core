/**
 * Compiled form or source, per memory: the production call site of the completeness gate.
 *
 * Approved atoms are compiled from a memory and rendered into advisory lines. Before those lines may
 * stand in for the memory, the gate (`decideDelivery` -> `irCompletenessGate`) reads the memory as
 * written against the knowledge the lines actually carry, and the whole memory goes one way:
 *
 *  - SUFFICIENT: the memory is delivered as its compiled form everywhere its body would go (the hook's
 *    body channel, the native knowledge files, Studio's turn context), and its lines reach the agent
 *    through the advisory channel as one group, all or none.
 *  - INSUFFICIENT: the memory is delivered as written, and its lines are withheld everywhere. A partial
 *    projection must never reach the agent as if it were the knowledge; that is the failure the gate
 *    exists for (a SELECTION that kept the winner and lost what to avoid).
 *
 * A line with no source memory to judge against (a rule's atoms, or an atom whose memory is no longer
 * active) keeps the additive delivery it had before: there is no body to replace and none to fall back to.
 *
 * Explicit reads are not delivery. `pathrule_read_memory` and friends always return the memory as
 * written, which is also what the compiled form points to.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: no model, no clock, no I/O. Same lines and memories, same plan.
