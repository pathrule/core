/**
 * Outcome observation: did the agent USE a delivered REMEDY, and did it work?
 *
 * V29 answers "was it delivered?". This layer adds a conservative, deterministic, model-free
 * attribution of USAGE and a narrow OUTCOME, keeping the epistemic ladder strictly separated:
 *
 *   DELIVERED  -> the advisory was placed in agent context (V29)
 *   OBSERVED   -> some tool event happened after delivery
 *   USED       -> deterministic evidence the agent acted ON this advisory (attribution)
 *   OUTCOME    -> what happened after the attributed action (narrow, often UNKNOWN)
 *   CAUSED     -> NOT decided here; V30 never claims causality
 *
 * The governing rule is that UNKNOWN is a first-class, correct answer. False attribution poisons
 * future ranking, so the two hard metrics are FALSE_USAGE_ATTRIBUTION = 0 and
 * FALSE_SUCCESS_ATTRIBUTION = 0: nothing is marked ATTRIBUTED / SUCCEEDED unless the evidence forces
 * it. Lack of usage is NOT failure (the condition may never have occurred); a command running is not
 * success; a task ending is not success.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. No model call, no I/O. It compares LIVE tool input (available only in the
 * hook / runtime process, never persisted) against a delivered advisory's action literals, and
 * returns only a categorical decision plus a reason code, so no knowledge content has to be stored to
 * attribute. Every decision carries a `reason` (Phase 37 / debug trace) so a future reviewer can see
 * exactly WHY an event was or was not attributed, without re-deriving it.
