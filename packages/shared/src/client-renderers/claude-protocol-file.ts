// Claude Code's auto-loaded copy of the protocol, and its removal.
//
// `.claude/rules/pathrule-protocol.md` is written by four separate places (CLI
// cloud sync, CLI local sync, the desktop companion writer, the MCP post-write
// hook) and owned by no renderer, so the orphan sweep in `disk-writer.ts` never
// looks at it. That is exactly why turning signature mode on is not enough on its
// own: we stop WRITING the file, nothing removes it, and Claude Code keeps
// auto-loading a copy that drifts further from the protocol the hook injects with
// every release.
//
// So the file is REMOVED rather than left. Removing it is safe by construction:
// the filename is Pathrule's own invention, it can hold no user content, and the
// only thing that ever wrote it is us.
//
// Node-only. One function so all four writers agree; four copies of this
// condition is how one of them would keep writing the file forever.
