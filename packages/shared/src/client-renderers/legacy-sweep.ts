// One-time cleanup of what an OLDER Pathrule left in a repo.
//
// Expecting existing users to run `pathrule eject` to clean up after us is not a
// migration, it is a chore we invented and handed to them. So everything that is
// PROVABLY ours goes automatically, and only the cases that need a human
// decision wait for one.
//
// The whole safety argument is one predicate. `planRecovery` classifies every
// leftover by whether it CARRIES USER CONTENT (see paths/recovery.ts): a backup
// that is byte-for-byte Pathrule's own output holds nothing to recover, and
// restoring it would write our stale bytes into the user's file as if they were
// theirs. Measured across two real repos: 7 of 8 leftovers were ours (seven
// identical copies of one file, all committed to git), 1 was the user's. This
// removes the seven and reports the one.
//
// Cost: `planRecovery` walks the tree, measured at 139 ms on this repo and 315 ms
// on a large one. A migration only has to happen once, and nothing in the current
// Pathrule creates these files any more, so it runs once per workspace per
// process rather than on every sync.

/**
 * Files Pathrule wrote under a name of its own invention, that NO current
 * renderer emits or claims in `ownedPaths`.
 *
 * The disk-writer sweep only deletes paths a renderer still owns, so a path we
 * stopped writing is invisible to it and stays in the user's repo forever,
 * drifting further from the truth with every release. `.claude/rules/pathrule-protocol.md`
 * hit exactly this and needed its own bespoke remover; these are the same class.
 *
 * Found on a real checkout 2026-09-01: both files present and untracked, no
 * writer for either anywhere in the codebase.
 *
 * Safe to delete by construction — the `pathrule-` filename is ours, it can hold
 * no user content — but the marker is still checked before unlinking, because
 * "we are sure this is ours" is exactly the reasoning that deletes someone's
 * file when it turns out to be wrong.
