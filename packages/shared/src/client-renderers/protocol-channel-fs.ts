//
//   const channel = await resolveWorkspaceProtocolChannel({ workspaceRoot, enabled, env });

// Cost is why the checks run in this order. Measured 2026-08-25:
//
//   detectInstalledHooks   ~1 ms      (8 small config reads)
//   planRecovery           139 ms cold / 56 ms warm on this repo,
//                          315 ms cold / 113 ms warm on calcom-demo
//
// Companion re-render runs after every knowledge write, so a 300 ms tree walk on
// that path is not acceptable. The flag is checked FIRST and returns before any
// I/O, so a workspace with the switch off pays nothing at all. The recovery walk
// is then latched per workspace, because what it looks for (a leftover from an
// older Pathrule) is rare and changes only when the user acts on it.

 * The rollout switch, now ON by default. `PATHRULE_SIGNATURE_MODE=off` (or
 * `0`/`false`) is the kill switch.
 *
 * It shipped off because the rule here is to measure before declaring, and the
 * measurement is now in. On a 27-memory workspace, 20 prompts and 300 tool calls
 * (2026-09-01):
 *
 *   hook injection      14.543 → 16.893 tok   (+2.351, the protocol and team
 *                                              block now ride SessionStart)
 *   always-loaded files  4.977 →    170 tok   (−4.807, only the signature left)
 *   NET                                        −2.456 tok over 20 turns
 *   files written           26 →      0        (22 of them nested, 16.306 tok
 *                                              of lazy-loaded turn-zero text)
 *
 * So the change users asked for — stop writing into our repo — is also cheaper,
 * because a constant block on SessionStart is paid once into the system prompt
 * while a compiled file is paid on every turn that loads it.
 *
 * Two gates still stand between this flag and a user's checkout, and both matter
 * more than the flag: signature mode engages only for a client whose hook is
 * actually installed (no hook, no alternative channel, so the files stay), and
 * never while a recovery backup is pending.
