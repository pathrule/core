// Which channel carries the agent protocol, decided ONCE for both halves.
//
// The protocol can live on disk (compiled into the user's instruction file) or
// on the hook index (injected once per session). The two halves are written by
// two different code paths — `renderForClients` for the files, `syncHookIndex`
// for the index — and the failure mode of letting each decide for itself is not
// symmetric:
//
//   both channels  → the agent reads the protocol twice on the first prompt.
//                    Wasteful, harmless.
//   neither        → the protocol is gone. Silent behaviour regression.
//
// So the decision is a single pure function whose output feeds both, and the
// invariant `protocolOnIndex === (signatureClients.length > 0)` is pinned by a
// test rather than by hoping two call sites stay in step.
