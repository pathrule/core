// Team context block: the one personalization surface Pathrule compiles into
// turn-zero instruction files.
//
// Why this channel and not the hook: the hook channel is paid PER TURN. The
// 2026-08-23 audit measured 157K tokens accumulated across 60 prompts in one
// long session, so anything constant belongs in the compiled file where the
// prompt cache pays for it once. This block is constant for a workspace, so it
// rides the compiled file.
//
// Why it is appended LAST in the file: a cached prefix is invalidated from the
// first changed byte onward. Team membership changes far more often than
// compiled knowledge, so the volatile block sits at the END and leaves the
// knowledge prefix byte-identical.
//
// Hard limits, from the plan (docs/konu-tasima-ekip-dongusu-plani.md, section 11):
//   - one block, once per file, never a second one
//   - at most TEAM_BLOCK_TOKEN_BUDGET tokens including the heading
//   - structured input only, rendered into fixed sentence frames
//   - no evaluative content: no performance, speed, quality or seniority claim
//
// The last point is enforced structurally rather than by review: this module
// accepts only names, paths, tags and a declared decision scope. There is no
// field an evaluative sentence could travel in, and free text is length-capped
// and whitespace-collapsed so a compiled file can never grow a paragraph here.
