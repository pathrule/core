/**
 * How much of Pathrule goes into the user's companion instruction files.
 *
 * - `slim`   — today's default: the agent protocol plus the context policy is
 *              compiled into the file.
 * - `signature` — the file carries three lines that say Pathrule is active and
 *              nothing else. The protocol travels on the hook index and is
 *              injected once per session, so a client with no Pathrule attached
 *              never reads an instruction it cannot carry out.
