/**
 * Executable CHECK atoms: knowledge that compiles into a verification requirement.
 *
 * Second consumer of the same idea CONSTRAINT proved. Where CONSTRAINT compiles to a
 * PreToolUse deny, CHECK compiles to "this turn is not finished until the required
 * verification has passed", enforced at Stop.
 *
 * Shares CONSTRAINT's authority model verbatim (`knowledge/constraint.ts`): every write
 * through the knowledge path lands `inferred` + `proposed` and compiles to nothing; only
 * an explicit human approval sets `human` + `active`. Two independent checks gate
 * enforcement so a bug that flips one field cannot grant it.
 *
 * One field CONSTRAINT does not have: `scope_path`.
 *
 * A regex scopes itself, because it only fires on text it matches. A CHECK's trigger IS
 * a path, so the path has to be expressible. Measured on the real example: the rule
 * `Write and run tests with every change` is `scope_type: project`, attached at `/`, so
 * inheriting the rule's scope would fire `pnpm --filter @pathrule/shared test` on an edit
 * anywhere in the workspace. `scope_path` NARROWS the rule's applicability and can never
 * widen it: the hook requires both that the rule applies to the path and that the path
 * sits under `scope_path`.
