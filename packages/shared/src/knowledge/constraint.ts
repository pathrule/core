/**
 * Executable CONSTRAINT atoms: the one piece of knowledge that leaves prose and
 * becomes deterministic runtime behaviour.
 *
 * Design in docs/agent-knowledge-constraint-slice.md. Three properties matter more
 * than the code:
 *
 *  1. AUTHORING CANNOT CLAIM AUTHORITY. `ConstraintInput` (what a surface accepts)
 *     carries no authority/status. Those are stamped here, and every write through
 *     the normal knowledge path lands `inferred` + `proposed`, which never compiles
 *     to anything enforceable. Fail-closed: the absence of an agent marker is not
 *     evidence of a human (see `resolveClientId()` returning null on an unrecognised
 *     client name), so a human is only ever recognised by an explicit approval.
 *
 *  2. ONE COMPILER, IN TS. The compiled form is stored data, so both hook-index
 *     builders (cloud SQL, local TS) merely carry it. `semantic_tags` already has two
 *     implementations that disagree; that is tolerable for ranking and not tolerable
 *     for a deny, because a rule that blocks in one edition and not the other is an
 *     indicator that cannot separate two cases with opposite fixes.
 *
 *  3. VALIDATED IN THE LANGUAGE THAT RUNS IT. The pattern is compiled with JS
 *     `new RegExp`, because the runtime that tests it is `pathrule-hook.js`. Postgres
 *     regex is a different language; validating there and running here is a drift
 *     source, and the legacy `pathrule_internal.extract_block_pattern` does exactly
 *     that. Nothing in this module goes through it.

 * that prose — and the proof is only as current as the prose. Rule bodies are rewritten
 * from at least five places today (the MCP update handler, the Studio editor writing
 * Supabase directly, the VSCode virtual filesystem, the maintenance proposal applier and
 * its rollback builder), and adding an invalidation hook to each is a list that goes

 *  - `human` and `inferred` authority are untouched. A person's approval was never a
 *    claim about this prose, so revoking it on a prose edit would be inventing a policy;
 *    `inferred` is not enforceable in the first place.
 *  - The check is CONTAINMENT of the exact source excerpt, not meaning. A rewrite that
 *    keeps the sentence and reverses it elsewhere in the body still passes, and no
 *    string comparison can see that. What this closes is the whole class where the
 *    grounding text is gone and the atom kept firing anyway.
 *
