 * hook index, the warehouse, the native knowledge files and Studio's turn context are built. It composes the
 * shipped `irCompletenessGate` with the runtime facts the delivery path knows: whether compiled IR EXISTS for
 * this memory yet (nothing approved yet), and, for the reason string only, whether the local model is
 * AVAILABLE at all (it is an optional downloadable component).
 *
 * Order of decisions (fail-closed; when in doubt, PROSE):
 *  1. No compiled IR yet (lazy compile pending / model absent) -> PROSE. Deterministic CONSTRAINT/CHECK
 *     enforcement and already-compiled knowledge are unaffected; they do not depend on this call.
 *  2. Compiled IR exists -> run the completeness gate on the DELIVERED projection -> IR if FULL, else PROSE.
 *
 * The model being unavailable never breaks delivery: it just means no NEW compilation and a prose fallback,
 * which is the existing deterministic behavior.
