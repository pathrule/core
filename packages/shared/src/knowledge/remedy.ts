 * REMEDY atoms: conditional corrective knowledge, in production.
 *
 * The semantics here are the ones frozen as `REMEDY_PRIMITIVE_V1` after eight measured
 * generations of research. Nothing in this file may relax them, and the two that carry the
 * safety of the whole primitive are:
 *
 *  - Only three evidence states are DELIVERABLE. A fix that was merely attempted, hedged,
 *    reverted or superseded is stored and never delivered. Turning weak historical evidence
 *    into authority is the failure the primitive exists to prevent.
 *  - Human authority comes from an APPROVAL, never from the kind of document the text sat in.
 *    That was learned by breaking it: reading "this came from a rule" as standing guidance let
 *    two mislabelled prohibitions be delivered as advice.
 *
 * A REMEDY is ADVISORY. It is never compiled, never enforced, and never executed. It does not
 * outrank a CONSTRAINT. This file therefore has no compiler and no hook-index projection, which
 * is the main thing that makes it shorter than `constraint.ts` and `check.ts`.
