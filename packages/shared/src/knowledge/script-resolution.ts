 * What does a package-manager script actually run?
 *
 * PURE. No `node:fs`, no imports beyond types, on purpose: `validateCheckInput` is
 * reached from `packages/cloud-connector/src/tools/write-tools.ts`, which is the remote
 * MCP running on Vercel with no repo filesystem at all. Putting I/O inside the shared
 * validator would make CHECK authoring impossible there rather than merely unresolved.
 *
 * So the split is: the caller that HAS a filesystem collects package.json data and hands
 * it in; this module answers from that data alone. A caller with no filesystem passes
 * nothing and gets `unresolved`, which is a stated outcome rather than a silent pass.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.
 *
 * It exists so the authoring layer can (a) refuse a requirement that provably never
 * terminates and (b) show a human what they are approving. It is NOT a second source of
 * runtime authority: evidence matching stays on the canonical fingerprint, and nothing
 * here is consulted at runtime.
 *
 * It is also not a shell interpreter. It follows the pnpm script forms this repo actually
 * uses and says `unresolved` for everything else. A generic interpreter would be the
 * wrong kind of confident.
