 *  - Human authority comes from an APPROVAL, never from the document the text sat in.
 *
 * The hard safety metric is FALSE_SELECTION = 0: a stored/delivered preference relationship must be
 * present in the source. An alternative is stored ONLY when the source names it; "prefer X here" with
 * no stated alternative yields a preference with NO alternative, never an invented "instead of Y".
