// The single transient-vs-terminal verdict for cloud calls.

// Getting this wrong costs once per call site: any error treated as terminal
// becomes a phantom logout, and any silence treated as a server answer becomes
// a false "your session expired". The rule this module encodes:
// TERMINAL means the server answered and said no. Everything else is transient,
// which means keep the current state and retry.
//
// Deliberately dependency-free so the renderer, the MCP server, and the main
// process can all share one verdict.

 * one write aimed at a table this deployment does not have block every write behind it.
 * The SQLSTATE forms (42P01 undefined_table, 42883 undefined_function, 42703

 *
 * Neither "retry now" nor "give up" is right for this. The usual cause is a client that

 * itself when the other side catches up, so the queue parks the write rather than
 * retrying it in a loop or holding it as a refusal. classifyError deliberately leaves the
 * PGRST forms `unknown`: a READ that hits one should keep falling back to the local
 * mirror, which is the more useful answer there. Only callers that stop on transient
