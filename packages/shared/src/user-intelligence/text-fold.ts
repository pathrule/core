 * harakat). A handful of Latin letters are their own letter rather than a base plus a mark, so NFD leaves
 * them alone; they are mapped explicitly, for every language that has one (Turkish ı, Polish ł,
 * Danish/Norwegian ø and æ, Croatian/Vietnamese đ, Icelandic ð and þ, Maltese ħ, Sami ŧ, German ß, French
 * œ). The rule is per LETTER, never per language: no language gets treatment another one with the same
 * kind of letter does not. Scripts without case or marks (CJK) pass through unchanged.
 * `pathrule-hook.js` applies the same rule.
